2016-06-17 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added a collection proxy for xAOD::TrigPassBitsContainer. The
	  lack of which produced some "semi-corrupt" files unfortunately.
	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-52

2016-05-03 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Taught the package how to build itself in standalone

2015-10-28 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Declared a CLID for xAOD::TrigPassBits as well, as it's needed
	  by the navigation when attaching it. Even if only the container
	  is recorded into StoreGate.
	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-45

2015-10-28 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Removed the DataLink code from TrigPassBits, as we agreed that
	  the uniquie key of the object would be coming from the navigation
	  instead. (We would use the subTypeIndex variable.)
	* Created an xAOD::makeTrigPassBits function, which is much like
	  the HLT::makeTrigPassBits function, just making use of some nice
	  new C++11 coding.
	* Updated the unit test to check the behaviour of the new code.
	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-44

2015-10-27 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Extended xAOD::TrigPassBits to hold on to the CLID, and some
	  sort of hashed key of the target container that it describes.
	  This key right now tries to store the hashed key provided by
	  StoreGate. But we may want to use some custom hashing for the
	  object labels in the navigation instead.
	* In either case, the persistent information should look like
	  this.
	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-43

2015-10-23 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added a new class, xAOD::TrigPassBits. Based (of course) on the
	  old TrigPassBits class.
	* Added a unit test for the type, to make sure that the basic bit
	  operations implemented in it are functional.
	* Enabled pedantic compilation with RootCore.
	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-42

2015-07-16 Will Buttinger <will@cern.ch>
	* Added Root/xAODTriggerCLIDs.cxx to get CLIDs detected at compile time
	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-41

2015-07-03 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Kraszmahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Explicitly initialising all primitive variables in all the
	  AuxInfo classes now.
	* This is to avoid irreproducibility issues with these types.
	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-40

2015-04-01 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Kraszmahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Trying to fix the memory leak reported in ATR-10698.
	* Unfortunately this tag is not compativble with the
	  AtlasProduction-20.1.X.Y caches, so couldn't test the
	  code yet. That test will happen in 00-00-35-branch.
	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-39

2015-03-09 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Kraszmahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Fixed Coverity bug #25111. It was a serious problem, but
	  luckily in a piece of code that was inactive. Still, it was good
	  that Coverity found the issue.
	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-38

2015-02-16 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Kraszmahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Fixed a bug in TriggerMenu_v1::chainSignatureLogicsAvailable(),
	  because it was asking for "its variable" with the wrong type.
	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-37

2015-02-11 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added name()/setName() functions to ByteStreamAuxContainer_v1,
	  to disable the warnings coming from the variable access monitoring
	  code in AnalysisBase.
	* Re-ordered the function implementations in ByteStreamAuxContainer_v1.cxx
	  to correspond to the order in which the functions are declared in the
	  header file.
	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-36

2014-12-18 Lukas Heinrich <lukas.heinrich@cern.ch>

2014-12-05 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>

	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-29

2014-11-26 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Merged the changes into the trunk of the package, to be able
	  to collect it into a nightly.
	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-28

2014-11-26 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Rewrote the code quite a bit after a short exchange with
	  Tomasz.
	* Added a CLID for xAOD::TrigComposite.
	* Added a unit test for the new code.

2014-11-26 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Made a test implementation for handing links to HLT objects
	  in xAOD::TrigComposite.
	* To be discussed in trigger core sw...

2014-11-26 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Before making any changes to xAOD::TrigComposite, cleaned up
	  the modifications from Gordon.
	* Set the svn:keywords property on the files that didn't have
	  it set yet.
	* Removed the hscript.yml file. Hwaf is not coming back any time
	  soon.
	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-27

2014-11-13  scott snyder  <snyder@bnl.gov>

	* Merging changees from xAODTrigger-00-00-25-01:
	* xAODTrigger/versions/EmTauRoIContainer_v1.h,
	xAODTrigger/versions/MuonRoIContainer_v1.h: Add SG_BASE
	declarations.

2014-11-03 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Adding a first stab at code identifying the different types
	  of EmTauRoI-s. Not tested at all yet.
	* Not tagging because of this just yet.

2014-09-10 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Applying the fix from xAODTrigger-00-00-20-branch.
	  (Typos in EnergySumRoI_v1.cxx.)
	* Attaching a custom collection proxy to BunchConfContainer_v1.
	  Very strange that this didn't bite me before...
	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-25

2014-08-28 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added the first version of TrigNavigation_v1. (Thanks Tomasz!)
	* Updated all the header files to take CLASS_DEF.h and
	  BaseInfo.h from xAODCore rather than SGTools. Simplifying
	  the headers this way.
	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-24

2014-08-11  scott snyder  <snyder@bnl.gov>

	* Tagging xAODTrigger-00-00-23.
	* Root/ByteStreamAuxContainer_v1.cxx (size): Fix vector bounds
	checks.

2014-07-23  scott snyder  <snyder@bnl.gov>

	* Tagging xAODTrigger-00-00-22.
	* xAODTrigger/versions/ByteStreamAuxContainer_v1.h,
	Root/ByteStreamAuxContainer_v1.cxx: Add size().

2014-06-12  scott snyder  <snyder@bnl.gov>

	* Tagging xAODTrigger-00-00-21.
	* xAODTrigger/versions/ByteStreamAuxContainer_v1.h,
	xAODTrigger/versions/ByteStreamAuxContainer_v1.icc,
	Root/ByteStreamAuxContainer_v1.cxx: Implement decoration
	interfaces.  Fix problem with getting auxid set correct when this
	object is read from a file.  Thread-safety fixes.
	* xAODTrigger/selection.xml: Updated.
	* cmt/requirements: Update dependencies.

2014-04-09  Arantxa Ruiz Martinez  <aranzazu.ruiz.martinez@cern.ch>
	* Moved calorimeter trigger classes (TrigCaloCluster and TrigEMCluster)
	  to new xAODTrigCalo package
	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-20

2014-04-08 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Could remove some of the exclusion rules after the recent
	  bugfixes in rootcling, but not all of them.
	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-19

2014-04-05 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Changed the name of GCCXML_DUMMY_INSTANTIATION to
	  a more unique name in the dictionary header. Was necessary,
	  as rootcling is complaining about seeing the same struct name
	  in multiple libraries. (Which really shouldn't clash actually,
	  but let's do this until ROOT 6 stops complaining about this.)
	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-18

2014-04-05 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Making the dictionary generation work correctly with ROOT 6.
	* Temporarily excluding a number of classes in selection.xml
	  until rootcling learns not to want to generate a dictionary for
	  every class that it encounters. :-P
	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-17

2014-02-14 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added a set of classes for saving the bunch configuration
	  metadata in a ROOT-readable way into the xAOD. While the
	  trigger configuration's bunch-group information is
	  available in xAOD::TriggerMenu already, we often get the
	  bunch configuration from another place. (For instance for
	  MC files.)
	* Only basic tests done so far.
	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-16

2014-02-12 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Re-implemented xAOD::TriggerMenu and its siblings. Now the
	  class is much more flat, allowing for trigger menu slimming
	  in the DxAOD files if needed.
	* Added bunch group information to xAOD::TriggerMenu. Added
	  just enough information that BunchCrossingTool would be
	  able to initialise itself from it.
	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-15

2014-02-06 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Adding HLT decision information to xAOD::TrigDecision_v1.
	* The design is that we would save 5 bits for the first N
	  (1024?) chains per trigger level. This seems to use
	  (togeteher with the LVL1 branches) ~0.176 kB per event
	  on a ttbar MC12 file. Seems reasonable for the full
	  trigger decision. (Can be slimmed to a fraction of its size
	  in case the user is not interested in some details.)
	* Remember though that this implementation is not storing
	  any information about the trigger navigation. That will come
	  in a different class.
	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-14

2014-01-24 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Updated the TrigComposite code a bit more to my liking.
	* This meant the first real-world usage of
	  ByteStreamAuxContainer_v1, uncovering a number of issues with
	  the class's implementation.
	* The code can now be used in some simple standalone examples.
	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-13

2014-01-24 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Migrated the package to compile with RootCore.
	* No other code changes done for the moment, some TrigComposite
	  manipulation is still to come.
	* Not tagging for now.

2014-01-23 Tomasz Bold
	* further additions for TrigComposite

2014-01-16 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Fixing a silly typo in xAOD::TriggerMenu. The word "passthrough"
	  is hard... :-P
	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-12

2014-01-15 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Removed the prescale key variables from the trigger decision
	  classes. It does make sense that they were not part of
	  TrigDec::TrigDecision either.
	* In order to find the correct configuration describing the current
	  event, introduced a new, extremely simple class: TrigConfKeys.
	  This will be created/handled in the to-be-created TrigConfigSvcxAOD
	  package. (Together with xAOD::TriggerMenu.)
	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-11

2014-01-14 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added a first (partial) implementation for xAOD::TrigDecision.
	  It just handles the LVL1 decision for the moment.
	* Added some missing SG_BASE(...) statements to the classes.
	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-10

2013-12-09 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Revised the RoI class implementations, making some simplifications
	  that we never got to do during Run 1.
	* The energy-sum and jet-ET RoIs are no longer stored in a container,
	  but just on their own. (As we did in the D3PDs already.)
	* Removed the redundant information from the classes which were kept
	  as purely transient data in case of the AOD classes.
	* Removed some "primitive" dictionaries from the package that should
	  be generated in some other place (xAODCore) if really needed.
	* Created a collection proxy for all the RoI containers.
	* Added some documentation to the RoI classes.
	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-09

2013-12-06 Lukas Heinrich <lukas.heinrich@cern.ch>
        * remaining ROI types converted to xAOD

2013-12-04 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Making the code compile standalone on MacOS X.
	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-08

2013-11-28 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added a CLID for TriggerMenuAuxContainer_v1.
	* Added some missing dictionaries for writing the trigger configuration
	  into an xAOD file.
	* Removed the usage of MsgStream from the cluster classes.
	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-07

2013-11-28  Aranzazu Ruiz Martinez  <aranzazu.ruiz.martinez@cern.ch>
	* First implementation of TrigCaloCluster and TrigEMCluster
	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-06

2013-11-27 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Implementing a bunch of missing functions in TriggerMenu_v1.
	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-05

2013-11-27 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Introduced a new class, TriggerMenu_v1, that should/could describe
	  the trigger configuration as ROOT-readable metadata in the xAOD
	  files.
	* Disabled the dictionary building for Muon_ROI_v1, as Lukas forgot to
	  check in the source files belonging to this class. The class will
	  be renamed anyway, so oh well...
	* Didn't do any I/O tests yet, just tried to compile the code using
	  hwaf.
	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-04

2013-11-25 Lukas Heinrich <lukas.heinrich@cern.ch>
	* Added first implementation of Muon_ROI as xAOD object
	* code tested with private AOD->xAOD converter

2013-11-15  Sebastien Binet  <binet@farnsworth>

	* tagging xAODTrigger-00-00-03
	* hwafize (really add hscript)
	* A hscript

2013-11-14  Sebastien Binet  <binet@farnsworth>

	* tagging xAODTrigger-00-00-02
	* hwafize
	* A hscript

2013-11-14 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Moved the ByteStreamAuxContainer_v1 class from xAODCore to this
	  package.
	* The code is wildly untested, but it does compile at least.
	* Will add an hwaf compilation description later on.
	* Tagging as xAODTrigger-00-00-01
